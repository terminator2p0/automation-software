This is an attempt to create an automation software to run files locally on my own office machine due to a severe restriction on the resources available.
This is still in the development phases as a lot of things need to be discussed and taken into consideration to run this smoothly.
However a small example app is created that will run the files here.
The actual python executable application file is in dist\software2.exe
